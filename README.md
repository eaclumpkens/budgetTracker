### User Story
```
AS AN avid traveller
I WANT to be able to track withdrawals and deposits
with or without a data/internet connection,
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when i'm traveling.
```

### Business Context

Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.
